#Quantium Sales Dashboard — Production-Ready Python Web Application with End-to-End Automated Testing

This project is inspired by the Quantium x Forage Virtual Internship, but rebuilt from scratch as a production-style web application featuring scalable architecture, automated UI testing, and clean software engineering practices.
It demonstrates proficiency in Python, Dash, Plotly, Selenium, PyTest, and modern testing workflows.
